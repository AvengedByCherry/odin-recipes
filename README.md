This project is for testing HTML basics learned from the odin project with their recipe project.

This project used some basic HTML tags to add links, images, headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists to boilerplate HTML to create an index HTML page that links off to 3 seperate pages that each contain a single recipe and an image of the completed product as well as what ingredients are needed and the steps to actually making them.

This project also served as a good practice of habit for using Git to make regular commits of changes to all of the files created.

1. Fixed missing h1 content on chickenfriedrice.html
2. Added style.css file and link tags to this file in all html files
3. Added some basic off the cuff styling to elements across all pages using types which included a background applying to the entire body, center alinging all h1, h2 and h3 tags along with p tags, setting a height for the images to help with page length and changing the font of the li and p tags.
